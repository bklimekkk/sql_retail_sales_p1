## Project Structure
### 1. Database Table Creation
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,

    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,

);
```
### 2. üîç Data Exploration & Cleaning
View the data:  
```sql

   OR category IS NULL
   OR quantity IS NULL
   OR price_per_unit IS NULL
   OR cogs IS NULL
   OR total_sale IS NULL;
```
Delete records with missing data:

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL
   OR sale_date IS NULL
   OR sale_time IS NULL
   OR customer_id IS NULL
   OR gender IS NULL
   OR age IS NULL
   OR category IS NULL
   OR quantity IS NULL
   OR price_per_unit IS NULL
   OR cogs IS NULL
   OR total_sale IS NULL;
